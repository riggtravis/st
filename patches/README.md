# What is this?
On any given branch, this directory will contain the relevant patches for that
branch. Each branch also represents one patch version documented on the
[st website](https://st.suckless.org/). Generally, you should not need to look
in this directory as the process to create your own version of the terminal
should be to create your own branch and then merge branches with patches you
want into your branch. Even so, this directory is still tracked in version
control for the sake of posterity.
